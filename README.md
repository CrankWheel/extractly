# Extractly



##  Mix task to Transform EEx templates in the context of the `Extractly` module.


  If a template is indicated than it is run in the context of the `Extractly` module which is
  passed in as variable `xtra`. And the output is written to a file named like the template without
  the `.eex` extension.

  This behavior can be changed via command line switches.

  Without an input template provided, the task is implying that `README.md.eex` was passed in.

  The `Extractly` module is available inside the templates but is also passed in as variable `xtra` for
  the convenience of the templates' authors.

  E.g. use the following template to extract some documentation from a module `M`.

      Some text
      <%= xtra.function_doc(M, :shiny_function/2) %>
      More text


## Usage:

    mix xtra [options]... [template]

### Options:

    --help     Prints short help information to stdout and exits.
    --version  Prints the current version to stdout and exits.
    --verbose  Prints additional output to stderr

    --output filename
              The name of the file the rendered template is written to, defaults to the templates'
              name, without the suffix `.eex`

### Argument:

    template, filename of the `EEx` template to use, defaults to `"README.md.eex"`
