##  Mix task to Transform EEx templates in the context of the `Extractly` module.

  This tool serves two purposes.

  1. A simple CLI to basicly `EEx.eval_file/2`

  1. Access to the `Extractly` module (available as binding `xtra` too)

  1. Access to the name of the rendered template with the `template` binding

  The `Extractly` module gives easy access to Elixir metainformation of the application using
  the `extractly` package, notably, _module_  and _function_ documentation.

  This is BTW the raison d'être of this package, simple creation of a `README.md` file with very simple
  access to the projects hex documentation.

  Thusly hexdoc and Github will always be synchronized.

  To see that in action just look at the [`README.md.eex`](README.md.eex) file of this package and compare
  with what you are reading here.


  Example Template:

      Some text
      <%= xtra.functiondoc("M.shiny_function/2") %>
      <%= xtra.moduledoc("String") %>

      More text


### Usage:

    mix xtra [options]... [template]

#### Options:

    --help | -h     Prints short help information to stdout and exits.
    --quiet | -q    No output to stdout or stderr
    --version | -v  Prints the current version to stdout and exits.
    --verbose       Prints additional output to stderr

    --output filename
              The name of the file the rendered template is written to, defaults to the templates'
              name, without the suffix `.eex`

#### Argument:

    template, filename of the `EEx` template to use, defaults to `"README.md.eex"`




### API

### Extractly.moduledoc/1

  Returns docstring of a module (or nil)
  Ex:

      Extractly.moduledoc("Extractly")
### Extractly.functiondoc/2

  Returns docstring of a function (or nil)
  Ex:

      iex(1)> Extractly.functiondoc("Extractly.moduledoc/1")
      [ "  Returns docstring of a module (or nil)",
        "  Ex:",
        "", 
        "      Extractly.moduledoc(\"Extractly\")",
        ""
        ] |> Enum.join("\n")

  We can also pass a list of functions to get their docs concatenated

      iex(2)> out = Extractly.functiondoc(["Extractly.moduledoc/1", "Extactly.functiondoc/2"])
      ...(2)> # as we are inside the docstring we required we would need a quine to check for the
      ...(2)> # output, let us simplify
      ...(2)> String.split(out, "\n") |> Enum.take(5)
      [ "  Returns docstring of a module (or nil)",
        "  Ex:",
        "", 
        "      Extractly.moduledoc(\"Extractly\")",
        ""]

  If all the functions are in the same module the following form can be used

      iex(3)> out = Extractly.functiondoc(["moduledoc/1", "functiondoc/2"], module: "Extractly")
      ...(3)> String.split(out, "\n") |> hd()
      "  Returns docstring of a module (or nil)"

  However it is convenient to add a markdown headline before each functiondoc, especially in these cases,
  it can be done by indicating the `headline: level` option

      iex(4)> out = Extractly.functiondoc(["moduledoc/1", "functiondoc/2"], module: "Extractly", headline: 2)
      ...(4)> String.split(out, "\n") |> Enum.take(3)
      [ "## Extractly.moduledoc/1",
        "",
        "  Returns docstring of a module (or nil)"]

  Often times we are interested by **all** public functiondocs...

      iex(5)> out = Extractly.functiondoc(:all, module: "Extractly", headline: 2)
      ...(5)> String.split(out, "\n") |> Enum.take(3)
      [ "## Extractly.do_not_edit_warning/1",
        "",
        "  Emits a comment including a message not to edit the created file, as it will be recreated from this template."]

### Extractly.macrodoc/1

  Returns docstring of a macro (or nil)

  Same naming convention for macros as for functions.


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `extractly` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:extractly, "~> 0.1.5"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/extractly](https://hexdocs.pm/extractly).
